# SetUp
Tools and steps to install them for the ScalaBridge course.

## Software

There are two routes to installing the software you need to develop Scala:

- *If you already have tools you are comfortable with* then you can continue to use them. You will need the example project below and [SBT][sbt]. If you go this route it is your responsibility to maintain your setup, though the mentors are likely to have experience with common tools like Emacs and Vim.

- *If you haven't programmed before or don't have a strong preference* we recommend you install the [IntelliJ Scala Bundle][intellij-scala]. Scroll the page a bit until you see the "Downloads" heading, and download the appropriate package from there.

## Base Project

The base project provides some basic configuration for the work we'll do at ScalaBridge. Depending on your group you will have a different base project:

- *If you don't have programming experience* get the [Creative Scala template][creative-scala-template]. Click the green "Clone or download" button and choose "Download ZIP". (If you know how to use Git you can clone or fork the repository instead.)

- *If you have programming experience, but not with Scala* TBC

- *If you have Scala experience* setup yourself up a project.
